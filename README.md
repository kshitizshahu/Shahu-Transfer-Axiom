// Shahu Loop Theory - Core Principle
// Axiom Name: Shahu Transfer Axiom
// Version: 1.0
// Author: Kshitiz Shahu

/*
 * Description:
 * In Shahu Loop Theory, the Shahu Transfer Axiom states that black holes function
 * not as physical conduits but as entropic bridges between causally linked universes.
 * When a black hole in Universe A consumes matter and energy, it does not transmit
 * particles directly. Instead, it accumulates entropy and compresses quantum information
 * until a critical threshold is reached. At this point, the black hole initiates a 
 * causal transfer, passing entropy and informational structure across the Shahu Bridge
 * to Universe B â€” a twin, inverse, or sacrificial universe.
 *
 * This process enables the formation of a new universe or the reversal of entropy
 * in a decaying one, all without matter-antimatter annihilation. The mechanism preserves
 * total information, adheres to thermodynamic and quantum conservation laws, and resolves
 * key paradoxes such as the black hole information loss problem.
